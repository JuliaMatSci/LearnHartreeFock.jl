## Learning Hatree-Fock By Doing

This package is focused on learning how to code a package for solving simple Hatree-Fock electronic structure calculations. 

The aim is to assist users of mainstream quantum chemistry and electronic structure software (e.g. NWChem, CP2K) with a more fundamental understanding of the steps associated with with all-electron wavefunction based approaches. This code will only address the Hatree-Fock approach (i.e. only electron exchange) and will assume simple basis-set (i.e. STO-3G). 

The code here is directly based on the implementation of Hatree-Fock in Matlab by [Prof. James Johns at the Univ. of Minnesota](http://www1.chem.umn.edu/groups/johns/index.html). This version is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which will have familiar syntax as Matlab, but has some promising performance advantages and has a liberal use MIT license.
