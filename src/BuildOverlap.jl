                      buildelecoverlap(basis::Basis)

returns the building of electron overlap integral matrix of expectation values:

     S_{m,n} = langle m | n rangle = int d tau phi_m phi_n 

Description: This function calculates the electron-electron overlap matrix which essential captures
the inner product projection of basis function m on n, this is neccessary to track basis-functions that
are not orthogonal to one another.

NOTES: multiple dispatch only for GaussOrbitals
